TO DO:


HIGH:

1. check all the "put" and make the right check to see if exists!!  - ok     also for "get"

2. Big-endian Little-endian

3. util.copyOfRange vs arrays.copyOfRange?? - ok

4. put my stuff in a different directories. - ok

5. int rating = nonSeenTransactions[hash];
   nonSeenTransactions.Add(hash, rating == null ? 1 : (rating + 1)); 
   IRI-0.9.3\Tangle.cs(41,47,41,61): "The result of the expression is always 'false' since a value of type 'int' is never equal to 'null' of type 'int?'"  - ok : irrelevant

6. File Position - ok

7. make sure that redundents are not eliminated from the executable. ("else" storageBundle.cs line:327)


MEDIUM:

1. get the *.iri files both from debug\release directories or from current directory... (Current.Directory / AppDomain...)
    any way they should not be included in this project.

2. Dictionary<int?, int?>

3. third party should be downloaded automatically. newtonsoft etc...

4. check licenses. - ok

5. to test also in release mode.

6. To check Java List AddRange vs C# AddRange regarding duplicates.

7. check arrays equals... & hashcode

8. Arrays.equal

9. why first send is all zeros??

10. to fix storageLong (at the moment I thorw an exception)

11. to add licensing stuff of others

12. formatting of API responses.


LOW:


1. Are Type & Sort ToString() methods are being used? maybe in comparators...

2. I took some stuff from specific SDK 7..8 and I need to keep an eye that there arn't any bug fixes and that they don't change...
	    or to go a different route and to most of the stuff with .Net classes thats will give me the bug fixes for free.

3. Socket socket = new Socket(Configuration.coordinator(), Node.PORT);
    Actually a TCP transport... to ask cfb

4. what is it with Buffer.BlockCopy??

6. RandomLocalThread - I use I think only one seed for all and not each thread has a seed.

7. working with byte sbyte socket etc...

8. "jreFreeMemory\": " + string.Empty + ", \"jreMaxMemory\": " + string.Empty + ", \"jreTotalMemory:" - string.empty --> 
    no jre here - maybe later I will change it to .Net framework stuff.

9. is ThradLocalRandom is random for each Thread?

10. make sure all e.ToString replaced with log


GITHUB:

1. before uploading to github not to foget to remove the nodes that are not default from nodes.iri


FURTHER DEVELOPMENT:

1. Multiplatform (.NET Core)

2. Web API

3. ARTIK Cloud

4. To make it work also on thin OS's (Windows RT etc..)

5. Perhaps also to make it work on an older dot net frameworks.

6. Wallet
